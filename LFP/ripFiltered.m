function [filtered] = ripFiltered(lfp)

%RIPFILTERED Filter signal between 100-200 Hz.

% Nyquist = 125 (with sampling rate = 250 Hz)
% since the sampling rate for axona is too low (every 0.0040 s), we make a high-pass filter
% to return signals greater than 100 Hz. The idea is to filter within the
% 100-200 Hz range, this can be changed with Neuralynx if there is a
% different sampling frequency. 
% will need to make the butterworth a bandpass filter for signals with
% higher sampling frequency. 
% Add timestamps as an input to this function so that we can calculate the
% sampling frequency and Nyquist limit for each EEG channel that is input.

%   USAGE:
%
%   INPUT:
%   lfp:            LFP signal (unfiltered) for a SINGLE channel.

%   OUTPUT:
%   filtered:       Filtered LFP signal

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FUNCTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% The Nyquist theorem states that a signal must be sampled at least twice as fast as the bandwidth of
% the signal to accurately reconstruct the waveform; otherwise, the high-frequency content will alias at a
% frequency inside the spectrum of interest (passband)
